\section{TIG Design}
\justify{The TIG Stack is built over K8s\footnote{https://github.com/lsst-it/gi-k8s}, but for servers, a telegraf service agent needs to be setup in each one. To accomplish this, the server's configuration was performed through puppet, which is a software configuration management tool that includes its own declarative language to describe the system configuration.}
